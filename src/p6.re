    10. Run-length encoding of a list. (easy)

    It should a list of tuples that specifies how many occurrences in a row a certain string appears. (easy)

    e.g.
    solve(["a","a","a","a","b","c","c","a","a","d","e","e","e","e"]) = [(4, "a"), (1, "b"), (2, "c"), (2, "a"), (1, "d"), (4, "e")]

printAnswer(solve(Data.p6));
